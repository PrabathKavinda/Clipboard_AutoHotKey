Cut, Copy, Paste Popup Notifier (AutoHotkey)

This project is a simple **Cut, Copy, Paste popup box notifier** built using **AutoHotkey scripts**.

‚ú® What It Does

Whenever the user performs a **Cut**, **Copy**, or **Paste** action, a small popup box appears at the bottom of the screen displaying one of the following messages:

- **"Copied"**
- **"Pasted"**
- **"Cut"**

It's a lightweight utility that gives visual feedback for clipboard actions.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script monitors clipboard events and triggers a custom popup notification based on the action taken. It's perfect for adding a quick visual cue while working with files or text.
